We start with materials that Keller et al. (2018, GENETICS) first reported. The text of their article is available here: 

http://www.genetics.org.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/content/209/1/335

or, for those not at the U. of Wisconsin, 

http://www.genetics.org/content/209/1/335



We download their data from Data Dryad: 

https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.pj105

Note that the above url gives information on citing and using the data that they share freely. **I'll need to reference this information in my thesis.**

## Reading the data

README.README has info on the objects that are contained within the file "Attie_DO378_eQTL_viewer_v1.Rdata".

Let's load the .Rdata file into an R session.

```{r}
load("../data/Attie_DO378_eQTL_viewer_v1.Rdata")
```
